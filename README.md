## Overview:

This project involves the creation of a Bank Analytics Dashboard to visualize and analyze key financial metrics for an organization. The dashboard provides insights into total premiums, equity value, profitability by city, assets under management, and cost ratios, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

## Key Features:
+ Total Premium Analysis: Tracked and visualized total premiums (245.9B) over time.

+ Equity Value Created: Highlighted equity value creation (230.8B) across stakeholders.

+ Profitability by City: Segmented profitability data by city and tenure (e.g., 1-3 years, >5 years).

+ Assets Under Management: Analyzed distribution across stakeholders (promoters, FII, DII, retail).

+ Cost Ratios: Compared opex, commission, and total cost ratios to profitability.


## Project Workflow:
**Data Collection**:
  + Gathered raw data from multiple sources (e.g., databases, spreadsheets).
  + Included metrics like premiums, equity value, profitability, and cost ratios.

**Data Cleaning**:
  + Handled missing values and outliers.
  + Filtered data by date, city, premium, and stakeholder type.

**Data Analysis**:
  + Calculated averages (e.g., average age of stakeholders).
  + Analyzed distributions (e.g., shareholding, assets under management).
  + Segmented data by city, tenure, and stakeholder type.

**Data Visualization**:
 + Created interactive dashboards to display key metrics.
 + Used charts and graphs to represent trends (e.g., premiums over time, profitability by city).

**Insights and Reporting**:
 + Identified trends and actionable insights for stakeholders.
 + Prepared a final report summarizing findings and recommendations.

## Key Insights:
+ Total Premium: 245.9B, with trends analyzed over time.

+ Equity Value: 230.8B created, segmented by stakeholder type.

+ Profitability: Highest in cities like Mumbai and Bangalore, with tenure-based insights.

+ Cost Ratios: Opex and commission ratios analyzed for profitability optimization.

## Conclusion:
This project successfully transformed raw financial data into actionable insights using data analysis and visualization. The dashboard empowers stakeholders to monitor performance, identify trends, and make informed decisions.
