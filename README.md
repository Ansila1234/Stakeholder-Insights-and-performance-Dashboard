# Stakeholder-Insights-and-performance-Dashboard

Overview:
This project involves the creation of a Bank Analytics Dashboard to visualize and analyze key financial metrics for a banking/insurance organization. The dashboard provides insights into total premiums, equity value, profitability by city, assets under management, and cost ratios, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

Key Features:
Total Premium Analysis: Tracked and visualized total premiums (245.9B) over time.

Equity Value Created: Highlighted equity value creation (230.8B) across stakeholders.

Profitability by City: Segmented profitability data by city and tenure (e.g., 1-3 years, >5 years).

Assets Under Management: Analyzed distribution across stakeholders (promoters, FII, DII, retail).

Cost Ratios: Compared opex, commission, and total cost ratios to profitability.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL

Data Visualization: Tableau, Power BI, or Excel

Data Cleaning: Python (Pandas), Excel

Version Control: Git, GitHub

Project Workflow:
Data Collection:

Gathered raw data from multiple sources (e.g., databases, spreadsheets).

Included metrics like premiums, equity value, profitability, and cost ratios.

Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values and outliers.

Filtered data by date, city, premium, and stakeholder type.

Data Analysis:

Calculated averages (e.g., average age of stakeholders).

Analyzed distributions (e.g., shareholding, assets under management).

Segmented data by city, tenure, and stakeholder type.

Data Visualization:

Created interactive dashboards to display key metrics.

Used charts and graphs to represent trends (e.g., premiums over time, profitability by city).

Insights and Reporting:

Identified trends and actionable insights for stakeholders.

Prepared a final report summarizing findings and recommendations.
